## About

Hello, I am Kristina Hsu (she/her/hers). I am a student pursuing the Geography degree with Data Science focus and also in minoring Informatics. My interests are in technology and human interaction with technology, but I am also an explorer that I often take courses out of my major to broaden my horizons. Outside of school, I enjoy photography, drawing, dancing, and traveling. And through various experiences, I have learned to connect each experience to my interest in data analysis. And I would love to continue expanding and strengthening my experiences in designing and creating ethical and sustainable technology.
